    <h2>Current World Problems in Governance & Banking</h2>
    <p>
      Today’s systems are dominated by corruption, inequality, slow bureaucracy, centralized control,
      unfair wealth distribution, unstable currencies, lack of global transparency, and elite control.
      From rising inflation to unjust leadership and political chaos, the people suffer while few benefit.

    <h2>The Rise of the AI Era</h2>
    <p>
      Artificial Intelligence is reshaping the future. From automation to predictive governance,
      it is already being used by big governments and corporations. The question is:
      Will it be used to control the people, or empower them?
