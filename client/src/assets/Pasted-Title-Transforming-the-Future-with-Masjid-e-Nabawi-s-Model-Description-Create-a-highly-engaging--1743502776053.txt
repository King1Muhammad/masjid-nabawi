2. Introduction to Islam & The Role of Masajids
Before Islam:

How the world was ruled by oppression, ignorance, and power-hungry elites.

No justice, no education, and slavery was a norm.

Women and the poor had no rights.

After Islam:

Prophet Muhammad (S.A.W) revolutionized humanity by introducing equality, justice, education, and economic systems.

Masjid-e-Nabawi became the first center of governance, knowledge, business, and welfare.

How Masajids Were Used in the Golden Era of Islam:

Education for all (men & women)

Governance & administration

Justice system (courts)

Social welfare & public services

Business & financial systems

3. The Decline of Muslims & How We Lost Our System
Why Did the Muslim World Decline?

Muslims moved away from Islam’s true teachings.

British enslaved us mentally through education & employment systems.

Masajids lost their original role and became only for prayers.

Pakistan got independence in 1947, but we continued the British system instead of reviving our Islamic governance.

Current Problems:

Corrupt governance

Economic inequality

Lack of real education (only degrees for jobs, no innovation)

Youth leaving Pakistan due to broken system
